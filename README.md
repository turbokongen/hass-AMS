Custom component reading AMS through MBus adapter into HomeAssistant
Supports the new energy dashboard in Home-Assistant.

If it does not decode your data, please submit a ticket, and I will try to 
make a parser for your meter.
If your meter type shown "unknown", please submit a ticket, and I will add 
your meter to the module.

Works with the following swedish and norwegian meters:

## *Installation
Easiest method is to install via HACS. Then setup via *Integrations* config.
*Or*
1. Copy *ams* folder into your *custom_components* folder.
2. Config by YAML setup or config by integrations in Home-assistant

*YAML options*
```yaml
ams:
  serial_port: '/dev/ttyUSB0' # Required. The serial port used to communicate through
  baudrate: 2400 # Optional, defaults to '2400'
  parity: 'N'  # Optional, defaults to 'N'
  meter_manufacturer: 'auto' # Optional, defaults to 'auto'
```

  
Start Home-Assistant, 
Set up the integration in the *Integrations* config if you haven't set up by YAML config.

For parity options see https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial/blob/master/serial/serialutil.py#L79

Meter manufacturer field options are:
```
'auto'
'aidon'
'aidon_se' # Swedish aidon meter RF2 modules
'kamstrup'
'kaifa'
'kaifa_se' # Swedish kaifa meters
```
This will create sensors for each of the available usage data in the meter.
The accumulative sensors will only be fully available after first read, and is transmitted from the meter 5 seconds past the hour.
There seems to be a bug in the current Kamstrup firmware that the hour package is transmitted at xx:xx:55.
